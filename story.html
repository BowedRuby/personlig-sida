                The story of NieR RepliCant begins in the summer of 2053 in the
                ruins of an unidentified city. A prolonged snowstorm envelops
                the region, trapping the few survivors in a gripping cold with
                little shelter and minimal food. Two who have made it through
                the onslaught of climate change lie hunkered down in the remains
                of a grocery store - a boy and his sister. The girl suffers from
                an uncontrollable cough, while her weary brother weighs a
                fateful decision. The mysterious book lying on the ground
                between them taunts the brother with its power to help. He only
                needs to hand over his soul to receive the tome's power. A
                number of monsters known as Shades appear and the brother fights
                them off to protect his sister with the help of the book. After
                defeating the Shades the child grows sicker.

                The story continues some 1,412 years in the future where a boy
                named Nier endures a similar struggle. His only sister has
                succumbed to a violent cough and must remain in bed while he
                searches for a cure. Though much time has passed, the world in
                which this brother and sister resides is, in many ways, one of a
                simpler time. Villagers live in modest homes and work together
                to ensure a better life for their community. The entire village
                knows of young Yonah's illness, and lends their support by
                hiring Nier for numerous odd jobs and errands. Some would say
                the work is beneath a man of his caliber, but he holds his head
                high and does whatever he can to provide for his sister, all the
                while hoping that the village's wisest member, Popola, and her
                twin sister Devola can discover a cure. One day, Yonah leaves to
                seek out the Lunar Tear flower her brother told her about, and
                may have gone off in search of the Lost Shrine where Popola told
                her where they grow. Upon searching the Lost Shrine, Nier
                stumbles upon a talking book capable of wielding magic, calling
                itself the Grimoire Weiss. The two team up to defeat the army of
                Shades and two living guardian statues to save Yonah. It is
                discovered that Yonah is suffering from the Black Scrawl virus,
                which is linked to the Shades. This partnership with Weiss
                allows Nier to use magic, and the two begin their quest to
                search the lands to collect all the Sealed Verses that Nier
                hopes will give Weiss the power to destroy the darkness and save
                his sister. In their search they encounter the hot-tempered,
                foul-mouthed Kainé, who is herself part-Shade, and a young boy
                Emil, whose eyes petrify anyone that gazes upon them. Their
                quest sees many hardships, culminating in Kainé becoming
                petrified in order to seal a deadly Shade beneath the library,
                while Yonah is carried away by the master Shade, known as the
                Shadowlord, who carries his own book, Grimoire Noir.

              <p>
                The Shadowlord makes his first in-game appearance when Nier's village is assaulted by Shades. Using Jack of Hearts as a diversion, the Shadowlord infiltrated the village library to kidnap the Replicant Yonah hiding inside it. Nier fought his way into the library, seemingly defeating the giant shade, but was ambushed by the Shadowlord. The Gestalt impaled Nier through his shoulder, critically wounding him. Despite their best efforts, Nier and Grimoire Weiss were held back by Grimoire Noir, whose defense allowed his master to be victorious in his goal. Fleeing with the Replicant Yonah in hand, the heroes were left to face the seemingly immortal Jack of Hearts inside the Library. After he returned to his castle to give his Yonah her body, Shadowlord guarded her. He was also aware that his replicant would come to his domain for Replicant Yonah. His plan was to wait for his Replicant to come to him, claim Nier's body as his own, and finally be reunited with his Yonah when she woke up. The hitch was being bested by Nier and Grimoire Weiss in combat. Wounded by his Replicant's attacks and powerless to stop her, he was devastated when his long-awaited reunion with Yonah ended with her committing suicide. Giving up any will to live, he allowed a clueless Nier to kill him soon after. His soul reunites with his Yonah in the afterlife, depending on the ending.

             Ending A: Replicant Nier is about to kill Gestalt Nier. He gazes at the Shadowlord, now having lost all hope. Replicant Nier hesitates for a second before dealing a final blow. Afterwards, Nier goes to Yonah's side. Worried when Yonah is not responding to his calls. Soon Grimoire Weiss, after losing his body, uses the last of his strength to speak. He tells Nier that she will awaken when someone says the name of the one she loves the most. The player is then given a choice to write their character's name. If entered correctly, Yonah slowly opens her eyes and observes her brother after the five years. Kainé goes to leave but is stopped by Nier, asking if she wanted to stay with them. She declines, saying she has "her own shit to take care of." The scene shifts over to Nier and Yonah back at the village, sitting on the hill near their house. Yonah runs up to a sitting Nier and gives her brother a Lunar Tear as the both lay down on the hill. The scene shifts again, showing an adult Yonah and The Shadowlord about to take each other's hand, then the adult Yonah takes hold and hugs The Shadowlord's arm, hinting that Gestalt Nier and Yonah have reunited.

           Ending B: Ending B starts the same as Ending A. After Replicant Nier defeats Gestalt Nier. The scene then changes to Gestalt Nier scrunched up, weeping to himself - alone in a white void - as he regrets all the hardships he put Yonah through. A flashback occurs, with Yonah and himself alone in the grocery store. He tells her that he isn't hungry, while Yonah tries to force him to eat something. The scene reverts back, and images of enemies that Replicant Nier killed gaze at him while he cries to himself. Gestalt Yonah, in her young form, comes to greet him and thanks him for always being there with her, and shares the cookie with her brother. Emil, who survived the blast, crash lands in the desert. Now just a head, he goes out to search for Nier and Kainé, bouncing and rolling into the distance.

        Ending C: Ending C is a continuation of endings A and B. After Nier defeats and kills the Shadowlord, as Kainé goes to leave she begins to relapse. She then goes into her shade form, forcing Nier to fight her. After Kainé is incapacitated, Tyrann explains to Nier how he can save her. Either by killing her, or forgoing his entire existence for her. If the player chooses the first option, Nier stabs Kainé as he kisses her, finally ending her pain.
        </p>
         <p>
                Ending D: If the player chooses to sacrifice his entire existence for Kainé, the player's data is erased and everyone forgets he ever existed. Nier disappears, while Yonah thanks Kainé for saving her. A lunar tear falls on the ground, which Kainé picks up. When she holds it, she has a flashback of Nier and mentions that it feels like she found something special, with her own words: "something very special".
