                Emil is a young, kind hearted boy who lives in the old mansion
                on the southern plains, tended to by his butler, Sebastian.
                Despite his gentle demeanor, Emil possesses unimaginable power -
                everyone he looks at is turned to stone. Rather than abuse this
                power, Emil is burdened by a terrible guilt and wears a
                blindfold to avoid petrifying anyone. He brings a sense of
                youthful exuberance and takes to Nier and Kainé as if they were
                the older brother and sister he's wanted his entire life.
                Eventually he is forced to petrify Kainé in an attempt to keep a
                monstrous Shade locked away, and five years later he requests
                for Nier to help him find a cure for reversing the effects in a
                laboratory in his mansion. While in the laboratory, Emil
                remembers that he was experimented upon by the National Weapons
                Laboratory in the search to create an "ultimate weapon". His
                sister Halua, labeled Number 6, became the ultimate weapon while
                he was known as Number 7 and kept in reserve, in case he was
                ever needed to keep her at bay. Their mission below the mansion
                is successful and Emil gains not only the ability to see without
                harm to others, but also the power to manipulate all forms of
                magic and and thus the power to reverse the effects of Kainé's
                petrification. There is a price, however: having gained this
                power through merging with his sister, Emil is granted a new
                form reminiscent of his sister's "weaponised" body; he becomes a
                skeletal creature that floats above the ground, wearing a ragged
                cloak and wielding an enchanted staff. At first he is ashamed of
                his new look, but learns to accept it once everyone assures him
                that they do not feel any differently towards him.

                Originally born in The Aerie, Kainé is a coarse individual who
                suffers from being only half human. Her left arm and left leg,
                which she keeps under bandage-like coverings, are those of a
                Shade. This hybrid form has left her to live as an outcast,
                unwelcome in villages and befriended by few. As a response to
                the harassment she received in her childhood for being an
                hermaphrodite, she took a liking to clothes that emphasize
                feminine characteristics. She has grown accustomed to being
                alone, and her veneer of shyness is easily shattered by sudden
                outbursts and irrational displays of violent anger. Though she
                is secretly glad to have Nier's company, she has already learned
                to survive on her own due to her grandmother who she loved
                dearly, her skill with twin swords, and her ability to wield
                magic. The only person that showed her kindness and protected
                her was her equally foul-mouthed grandmother Kali, with whom
                Kainé lived her childhood and inherited her attitude from. She
                held both love and respect for her grandmother who accepted her
                and treated her as a woman. One day when returning home, she
                encountered the shade Hook, who was attacking Kali's house and
                had her pinned down, sadistically enjoying Kainé's despair. Kali
                died in the incident and Kainé was left mutilated. It was then
                that the Shade Tyrann fused with her, allowing her to live and
                causing Kainé's deep hatred of Shades. When half of her body was
                taken over by Tyrann, she became a Shade-possessed and gained
                humanly impossible battle power and the ability to hear the
                voices of the Shades, but despite this had convinced herself
                that they are all evil and deserve to die (Tyrann even mockingly
                asks her if she's going to sympathize with the Shade Gretel
                after hearing its vow to protect its fellow Shades). By becoming
                possessed, Kainé suffered even more persecution and lived only
                to exact her revenge even if it meant using the powers of a
                Shade.

                Nier is a teenage boy left to watch over his only sister
                following his mother's untimely demise some years ago. He loves
                his sister deeply and strives each day to provide for her as
                best he can. Nier is also a skilled fighter trained in the ways
                of the one-handed sword. Over time, he comes to possess a
                mastery of the spear and two-handed sword as well. These skills,
                and many more, come in handy as Nier dedicates himself to
                finding a cure for his sister's illness. In the story "The Red
                and the Black" from Grimoire Nier, it is revealed that at the age
                of 15 he was coerced into an implied homosexual relationship
                with a man in Seafront, in exchange for money to help care for
                Yonah. He despised the man, and when he later joined an
                expedition to kill Shades, which by coincidence the man had
                joined as well, it is implied that during the battle Nier took
                the opportunity to kill the man. It was this event that made
                Nier unsure of the distinction between humans and Shades, as he
                found that killing them "felt the same".

                Over a thousand years later, Yonah is Nier's only
                daughter/sister and loves her father/brother deeply, but is
                young and doesn't always do what she's told. Despite her
                illness, she struggles against Nier's rules and tries to sneak
                out of the house whenever she can, often going to the library.
                When Nier tells her of a Lunar Tear, which can help her illness,
                she leaves the house to go to a temple and has to be rescued by
                her father/brother and Grimoire Weiss. For the rest of the time
                after that she stays at home. At the end of the first part,
                Yonah is kidnapped and taken away by the Shadowlord. The
                Shadowlord (Gestalt Nier) realized that Gestalt Yonah's relapse
                couldn’t be stopped, and planned to give his all to put her soul
                into Replicant Yonah. After five years , Nier, Kainé and Weiss
                reach the Shadowlord's chamber and, after defeating Grimoire
                Noir, they discover that the Shadowlord is the original "Nier"
                as seen in the game's prologue, who was the primary test subject
                for the Gestalt Project, and driven by an identical desire to
                protect his daughter/sister. Having taken Yonah, he has given
                the original human Yonah her Replicant body, but this Yonah
                realizes that she cannot keep it, as she hears the Replicant
                Yonah calling for her father/brother. She vacates the body, and
                Nier and the Shadowlord do battle. During the fight, Weiss loses
                all his strength and disappears, leaving Nier to fight the
                Shadowlord alone. After defeating him, Nier and Yonah are
                reunited. However without their souls, the Replicants are doomed
                to extinction.
